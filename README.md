#Introduction

I am currently a Sophomore at Texas State University. I am a Computer Science major, alongside my identical twin sister [Cassandra Coyle](www.cassiecoyle.me). I am excited to continue learning about how Computer Science applies to the world and how it improves our day-to-day lives.

Here is the [link](https://github.com/sicoyle/txstcs) to my school repository as I continue learning and improving my Computer Science skills at Texas State University.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sicoyle/sicoyle.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
