## Welcome to Samantha Coyle's Website

I am currently a student at Texas State University. I love all things math and sceince related, so I decided to become a Computer Science major, alongside my identical twin sister [Cassandra Coyle](www.cassiecoyle.me). I am excited to continue learning about how Computer Science applies to the world and how it improves our day-to-day lives.

Here is a [link](https://github.com/sicoyle/txstcs) to my school repository as I continue to improve my skills.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sicoyle/sicoyle.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
