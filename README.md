## Welcome to Samantha Coyle's Website

I am currently a student at Texas State University. I love all things math and sceince related, so I decided to become a Computer Science major, alongside my identical twin sister [Cassandra Coyle](cassiecoyle.me). I am excited to continue learning about how Computer Science applies to the world and how it improves our day-to-day lives.
